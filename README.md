# Predicting-data-science-performance-from-log-data-using-machine-learning
This project predicts student performance using machine learning on e-learning log data. A Random Forest model is used with features like time spent and activity type. The model offers high accuracy, providing insights for early intervention to improve student outcomes.

# Predicting Student Performance from Log Data

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict student performance based on log data from e-learning platforms. The model, built using a Random Forest classifier, employs feature engineering to predict academic success. The code covers preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results visualization.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and encodes categorical data.
- **Model:** Implements Random Forest for performance prediction.
- **Evaluation:** Uses accuracy, ROC curve, confusion matrix, and learning curve for model assessment.
- **Visualization:** Plots to analyze model performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
